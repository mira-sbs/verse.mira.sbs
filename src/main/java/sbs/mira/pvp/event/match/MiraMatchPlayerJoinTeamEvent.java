/**
 * event that should fire when a player joins a team during an active match.
 * this can occur at the start of a match (automatically for queued players),
 * or during the middle of a match if a player joins late / leaves to spectate.
 * this event can be cancelled if the player should not be allowed to join.
 * therefore, this event should fire prior to the team assignment logic (for cancelling).
